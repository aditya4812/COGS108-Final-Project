    "One of our family members works for one of the largest wine manufacturers in the US, and we’ve all noticed over that there are different shelves at stores with stark differences in price. The higher shelves generally had the most expensive and “high quality wines” while the lower shelves included the cheaper and “lower quality wines”. Not being wine enthusiasts ourselves, we thought about why the price for some of the top shelf wines was much higher than the ones on the bottom shelves. Then we asked the question: does the higher priced wine actually tastes better than the cheaper wine?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "   While doing our background research we found a few articles and studies that have explored the question we posed. In a study done by the American Association of Wine Enthusiasts, the researchers posed the question “Does More Expensive Wine Taste Better?” and used a series of blind tastings to collect their observations. Using a sample pool of more than 6000 blind taste tests, they found that the correlation between price and overall rating is small and negative, which suggested that the individuals enjoyed the more expensive wines slightly less. Their results in the study indicated that the prices of wines and recommendations of wines by experts may not be a good guide for non-expert wine consumers.[1] Another study we looked at was a study done by a Caltech professor in which he had volunteers sampled several different wines that were labeled with increasing prices. However, the prices were labeled inaccurately and the taster’s brain was observed using an MRI. When tasting the same wine twice but with different price tags, the portion of the brain that encodes the experienced pleasantness of an experience reflected an increase in activity when tasting the wine with the higher price tag. This study goes to show that the perception of a wine’s quality affects the way in which the brain processes the experience of the tasting.[2]\n",

    "The dataset we will be using to conduct our research was acquired from Kaggle, a public database of information and statistics, so we believe that we do have permission to use this data. There are definitely biases present in our dataset, specifically involving the financial status and psychological biases of the people being surveyed in some of the data. We don’t believe that this will be problematic in terms of making equitable analysis because these biases operate within the scope of the research question. For example, even though the dataset is mostly composed of financially stable adults over the age of 21, this doesn’t affect the accuracy of the answer to the question “Is there a correlation between the price of wine and its corresponding WineEnthusiast score?” This is because the question applies almost exclusively to the group of people being surveyed, which means we will not be unethically leaving out a portion of the population when considering the data’s implications. Additionally, there is the possibility of a naturally created psychological bias favoring wines that are expensive. Although this bias may skew the accuracy of our dataset, we believe it is a valuable lesson in analyzing the way the human brain changes its opinions based on external factors. We believe this bias isn’t problematic either, as diving deeper and learning more about its possible presence is valuable for research in this topic.\n"
